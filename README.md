# 🔄 GeoAngleNet

A deep learning project for estimating **relative rotation angles** between two shape images using **autoencoder-based corner detection** and **polar coordinate regression**.

This project combines synthetic data generation, autoencoder-based feature extraction, and a regression model that learns to predict rotation angles using the sine of polar angular features.

## 🎯 Objective

Estimate the **rotation angle** between two versions of a 4-cornered shape that has been rotated with noise. The angle prediction is done by:

1. Detecting shape corners using an autoencoder.
2. Converting corners into **polar coordinates** (relative to shape centroid).
3. Using the **sine of polar angles** as features.
4. Predicting the **sine of the relative rotation angle** using an MLP regressor.
5. Converting predicted `sin(θ)` back into degrees.

## 🔁 Pipeline Overview

### 1. Synthetic Shape Dataset Generation
- Shapes are generated with random positions and 4 corners.
- Each shape is randomly rotated and stored as:
  - Input shape image
  - Corner mask
  - Ground truth rotation angle

### 2. Autoencoder-Based Corner Detection
- An autoencoder learns to reconstruct corner masks from shape inputs.
- The encoder captures latent shape features and outputs a **corner probability mask**.

### 3. Polar Coordinate Conversion
- Detected corner coordinates are converted into polar form `(r, θ)` relative to the shape's centroid.
- Only **θ** is used, and represented as **`sin(θ)`** to maintain smoothness across angle boundaries.

### 4. Angle Regression via Polar Feature Comparison
- Corner features from two shapes are compared.
- An **MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron)** learns to regress the sine of the relative rotation angle.
- The prediction is `sin(Δθ)` → `arcsin()` → final angle in degrees.

## 📊 Why Angle Estimation is Hard

- **360° Wraparound**: Regression near 0°/360° is unstable without trig-based encoding.
- **Shape Symmetry**: Many shapes (like squares) look similar at multiple orientations.
- **Noise & Perturbation**: Slight changes in detected corners can throw off angle estimation.
- **Loss Discontinuity**: Angle loss without using sine/cosine representation suffers from large jumps around boundary angles.

## 🧠 Model Architecture

### Autoencoder
- Encoder: Conv → ReLU → Downsample
- Decoder: Upsample → Conv → Sigmoid
- Output: Corner mask prediction

### Regressor (MLP)
- Input: Polar sine features from two shapes
- Architecture: Dense → ReLU → Dense → Output (`sin(angle)`)
- Output: Predicted `sin(Δθ)` → Converted to degrees
